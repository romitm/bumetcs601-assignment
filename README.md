What the Project contains
--
The Project consists of static files (HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery). It also contains dynamic components included in PHP. The formation and structure is mentioned below:

> **Structure:**
> 
> - **db:** This contains the Database SQL Queries which will get you started with the Project. Please note you will need a prior installation of MySQL. The installation of the Database is out of scope of this Setup.
> - **images:** The images folder have all the relevant images, animated GIFs audio and video files that will be required by the website to show. *Please note that these assets are copyrighted and will require permission for use elsewhere.*
> - **scripts:** The scripts folder contain the Javascript and JQuery libraries to run the website. It also contains the Vendor libraries which are required.
> - **styles:** The styles folder contains the Stylesheets for the required pages on the site.

PHP Requirement
---
You will need to have PHP on your local system / server where you are executing the Project. Please get an installation of PHP 5.2 or higher for executing the Application. The installation steps are out of scope for this document for now.

Server Requirement
---

To execute the Project you will require an Apache (or any other Web Server) and an instance of a MySQL Database.

> - You will then need to execute the Queries in the `/db/mysqlqueries.txt
` file. 
> - Once done with the above step, deploy the rest of the assets in the Webroot folder for the Apache Server. 
> *Please note that you will need to find out what the Webroot folder fr your server is. For instance Apache on a Mac would typically have `/Library/WebServer/Documents` as the Apache Server document root.*
> - Restart the Apache Server instance.
> - Launch the webpage http://localhost/home.html
